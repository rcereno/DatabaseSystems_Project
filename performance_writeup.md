```

The queries for this endpoint were already optimized and using efficient index scans. The execution times for the individual queries were fast, so no further optimization was needed. The overall execution time improved from 264.66 ms to 163.83 ms after optimization.
### 2. `GET /catalog/`

**EXPLAINATION output:**

```sql

                          Heap Fetches: 6
Planning Time: 0.200 ms
Execution Time: 64.532 ms
```

This endpoint was optimized by adding indexes idx_games_all_columns and idx_reviews_game_id_review. The query now uses efficient index scans and parallel processing, resulting in a significant performance improvement. The execution time improved from 266.62 ms to 64.532 ms after optimization.

### 3. `GET /accounts/1407166/view`

**EXPLAINATION output:**

```sql
Explain Analyze for SELECT games.name FROM purchases:
Nested Loop  (cost=0.57..5.32 rows=2 width=32) (actual time=0.020..0.020 rows=0 loops=1)
  ->  Index Only Scan using purchases_pkey on purchases  (cost=0.29..1.43 rows=2 width=4) (actual time=0.019..0.019 rows=0 loops=1)
        Index Cond: (account_id = 1407166)
        Heap Fetches: 0
  ->  Index Only Scan using idx_games_all_columns on games  (cost=0.28..1.95 rows=1 width=36) (never executed)
        Index Cond: (id = purchases.game_id)
        Heap Fetches: 0
Planning Time: 0.181 ms
Execution Time: 0.046 ms

Explain Analyze for SELECT games.name FROM wishlisted:
Merge Join  (cost=0.70..7.28 rows=4 width=32) (actual time=0.029..0.029 rows=0 loops=1)
  Merge Cond: (wishlisted.game_id = games.id)
  ->  Index Only Scan using wishlisted_pkey on wishlisted  (cost=0.42..2.69 rows=4 width=4) (actual time=0.028..0.028 rows=0 loops=1)

        Heap Fetches: 0
Planning Time: 0.165 ms
Execution Time: 0.060 ms
```

The queries for this endpoint were optimized and using efficient index scans. The execution times for the individual queries were fast, so no further optimization was needed. The overall execution time improved from 200.91 ms to 161.18 ms after optimization.

## Summary

After adding the necessary indexes and optimizing the queries, the performance of the three slowest endpoints has improved by:

1. `POST /carts/313872/checkout`: 163.83 ms (acceptable)
2. `GET /catalog/`: 245.51 ms (acceptable)
3. `GET /accounts/1407166/view`: 161.18 ms (acceptable)

The execution times are now within an acceptable range, but it's important to continue monitoring performance under different workloads and data volumes, and make further optimizations if needed.
