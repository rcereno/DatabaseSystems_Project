#### Link to python file: (insert here)

#### Write-up:
To get to a million rows of data, the amount of final rows of data that we needed to each to get to a million rows was adding a million rows to our games catalog and our reviews database (note to team: feel free to adjust based on type of data we populated/constructed). [explain what script does here]. To justify why we think our service would scale in this way is due to the way we set up our shop as an e-commerce game store for gamers  and assuming that our intended audience of gamers would wishlist, buy, or place the games in their carts based off of the reviews or recommendations, in terms of how recommendations are created from owned games and reviews, given to them.
