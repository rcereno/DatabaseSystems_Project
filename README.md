Proposal:
Our project idea is an ecommerce store for video games where customers can browse, search, purchase, and review games. They can search/browse by category, price, console, popularity, etc. Our project will handle adding new games to sell, tracking stock/inventory, processing orders, and managing user accounts. Users will be able to see what games they currently have, any reviews they have left, and their credits available to spend. It will also support sales items.
